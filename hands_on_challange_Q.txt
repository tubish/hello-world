How to solve these coding challenges:

Write your solution in PyCharm or in your preferred Python IDE.

If your solution is not correct, then try to understand the error messages, watch the video again, rewrite the solution, and test it again. Repeat this step until you get the correct solution.

Save the solution in a file for future reference or recap.



Challenge #1

Create a Python script that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of each number less than the asked number.

Challenge #2

Consider the following string: nums = '10,20,30,40,50'

Create a Python script that creates a list of integers from the string.

The resulting list will be: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

Challenge #3

Write a Python script that finds all numbers that are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 1500 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence (CSV) on a single line.

Challenge #4

Write a program that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words separated by whitespaces.

Make it to print back the same string with the words in backward order.

For example, say I type the string: My name is Andrei

Then the script should print out: Andrei is name My

Challenge #5

Write a Python program that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.

Sample input string : green-red-yellow-black-white

Expected Result : black-green-red-white-yellow

Challenge #8

Consider a list of words(strings). Write a Python script that generates a list of tuples where the first element of the tuple is the word in the list and the second element is its length.

Use list comprehension if possible.

Sample List: words = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Golang', 'Solidity', 'Bash']

Expected Result: [('Python', 6), ('Java', 4), ('C++', 3), ('Golang', 6), ('Solidity', 8), ('Bash', 4)]

Challenge #9

Consider a list of words(strings). Write a Python script that generates a dictionary where the key is the word in the list and the value is its length.

Sample List: words = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Golang', 'Solidity', 'Bash']

Expected Result: {'Python': 6, 'Java': 4, 'C++': 3, 'Golang': 6, 'Solidity': 8, 'Bash': 4}

Challenge #10

Consider the following 2 Lists: names = ["Dan", "John", "Diana"] and phones = [11111, 2222, 3333].

Create a Set that contains the elements of the 2 lists in pairs.

The resulting set should be: {('John', 2222), ('Diana', 3333), ('Dan', 11111)}
